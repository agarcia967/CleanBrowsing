# CleanFandom
Fandom has taken over every Wiki for gaming and other types of fandoms, resulting in a corporate, bloated, ad-heavy experience. This filter intends to clean up the Fandom website of annoying ads and additional content.

While this filter list is quite helpful, there are other resources out there that could use your support for their initiatives.

# FAQ
Q: There's still a big empty panel on the left side. What's up with that?

A: Unfortunately, this is not an element in an of itself, it is a margin from the main content, so it can't be fixed with a simple filter list. However, you can make it smaller. Simply click inside the empty box, and then refresh the page. It will usually go away.
