# CleanFandom
Fandom has taken over just about every Wiki for gaming and other types of fandoms, resulting in a corporate, bloated, ad-heavy experience. This filter list intends to clean up the Fandom website of annoying ads and excess content.

While this filter list is quite helpful, there are other resources out there that could use your support for their initiatives.

# How to Use
This filter list was developed for use with [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/). Other suggested settings to enable within Brave:
* "Shields Up" (required to use filter lists)
* Advanced Controls:
  * Aggressively block trackers & ads
  * Block fingerprinting
  * Block third-party cookies

To install in Brave:
1. Click on the "CleanFandom.txt" in this repository.
2. Click on the "raw" button on the far right.
3. Copy the address from from this new plain text GitHub page.
4. Enter "brave://settings/shields/filters" into your address bar.
5. Scroll down to "Add custom filter lists".
6. Paste the address from step 3 into the "Enter filter list URL" text field and click "Add".

To install in Firefox (tested), Edge (untested), or Chrome (untested):
1. Install the uBlock Origin Extension.
2. Follow the instructions to install custom filter lists on the [uBlock GitHub page](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists).

It appears that Safari does not support Custom Filter Lists either natively nor with the uBlock Origin Extension.

# Other Suggestions
1. Please don't use MS Edge or Google Chrome, use Brave or some other Privacy respecting Browser instead.
2. Click the "Expand" button in the upper-left to get more real estate for reading actual content.

# FAQ
Q: There's still a big empty panel on the left side. What's up with that?

A: Unfortunately, this is not an element in an of itself, it is a margin from the main content, so it can't be fixed with a simple filter list. However, you can make it smaller. Simply click inside the empty box, and then refresh the page. It will usually go away.
